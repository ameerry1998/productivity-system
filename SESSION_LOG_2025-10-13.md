# Productivity System - Session Log: October 13, 2025

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Duration:** ~8 hours  
**Status:** ✅ WATCHDOG FIXED, SYSTEM OPERATIONAL

---

## TL;DR - What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **CRITICAL: Watchdog now restarts services** (was completely broken)
2. ✅ **Network detection fixed** (removed stale cache)
3. ✅ **25 browsers now blocked** (was 12)
4. ⚠️ **PAM/YubiKey still needs work** (password-only, not secure)

## How to Use This Log in Future Sessions

### For You (User):
1. Share this file with AI: *"Read SESSION_LOG_2025-10-13.md for context"*
2. AI will understand full system state and history
3. Avoids re-explaining architecture and past issues

### For Future AI:
- Read "Current System State" section first
- Check "Known Issues & Pending Work" for what needs fixing
- **READ PAM WARNINGS** before touching `/etc/pam.d/sudo`!

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Management
productivity-manager status
productivity-reload  # Reload scripts after editing

# Debugging
productivity-logs live
sudo tail -f /var/log/productivity_watchdog.log

# Test watchdog
sudo pkill -f browser_timer.sh
# Wait 20 seconds, check if restarted:
ps aux | grep browser_timer.sh
```

---

## Critical Watchdog Fix (Line 51)

**BROKEN CODE (was causing all issues):**
```bash
is_service_running() {
    launchctl list | grep -q "$service_name"
}
# Returns TRUE even if crashed!
```

**FIXED CODE:**
```bash
is_service_running() {
    launchctl list | grep "$service_name" | grep -qv "^-"
}
# Only TRUE if has real PID
```

## System Architecture Overview

```
Master Watchdog (15-second cycles)
├── screen_lock.sh (browser blocker at home)
├── browser_timer.sh (4.5h daily limit)
├── home_usage_limiter.sh (4h home limit)
├── time_protection.sh
├── block_apple_configurator.sh
├── browser_control.sh
└── (profile monitor - currently stopped)
```

**Files:** `/usr/local/productivity/*.sh`  
**LaunchDaemons:** `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.productivity.*.plist`  
**Logs:** `/var/log/*.log`

---

## Known Issues

1. **lock service** - Has launchd I/O error (non-critical)
2. **YubiKey sudo** - NOT configured (password-only)
3. **profile service** - Stopped (low priority)

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] **YubiKey PAM** - Restore sudo protection (BE CAREFUL!)
2. [ ] Make scripts immutable
3. [ ] Fix lock service I/O error
4. [ ] Test full system reboot

---

## ⚠️ PAM WARNING

**User was locked out before!** Read full PAM section in complete log before touching `/etc/pam.d/sudo`.

**Current config has `pam_deny.so` which WILL lock you out if YubiKey fails!**

Must include `pam_opendirectory.so` for password fallback.
